= Setting up Enonic
:toc: right
:imagesdir: media/

In this chapter, we will create an Enonic app based on the https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/introduction[`Introduction`] starter kit and launch a local development environment of the platform.

== Enonic at a glance

Our platform is called "Enonic XP" (or simply "Enonic").

=== Enonic apps
Enonic applications are essentially how you extend and customize the platform. Enonic XP allows you to install and run one or more link:https://developer.enonic.com/guides/developer-101/xp7/apps[**applications**] in a single platform instance.

Discover ready-to-run applications on link:https://market.enonic.com/[Enonic Market], or build your own. You will create an app of your own in this tutorial.

An application typically provides specific functionality. It may for instance produce everything needed for a large website, or provide specific microservices, such as an **API**. An app is given a unique <<#new-project, **app name**>> when it's built.

TIP: Useful terminology: A **sandbox** is a local instance of Enonic XP platform running on your PC/laptop. Once an app is built, it can be **deployed** to the sandbox - where it will be started and made available.

=== Content

Apps typically ship with one or more link:https://developer.enonic.com/guides/developer-101/xp7/content[**content types**]. Content types typically define data structures, JSON style. Each content type gets a unique name which is automatically pre-fixed with the app-name. e.g. `<appName>:<contentTypeName>`.

Content types are used to create **content items**. Content is commonly created and handled via Enonic's link:https://enonic.com/blog/publishing-power-enonic-content-studio-cheat-sheet[**Content Studio**]. Content may be organised in tree structures, which can be useful both for internal, and external purposes - as you will see in this tutorial.

Each content items has a unique **name** within it's path - similar to files and folders in a filesystem. It also has a human-friendly display name.

Content items exist in two different link:https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/storage/branches[**branches**]. When creating or editing in Content Studio, you're always working in the `draft` branch. When published, changes will be copied to the `master` branch.

== The Movie Database

With Enonic, you can obviously create your own content model from scratch, but to save time you'll be using link:https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/intro[Introduction app] as a template.

This app ships with a pre-defined content-model, and sample content from the cinematic industry.

Let's get going!

=== Task: Install the Enonic CLI

link:https://developer.enonic.com/start[**Install the Enonic CLI**] (follow link for instructions).

=== Task: Create and start a sandbox

. Create a sandbox called `mysandbox` by running this command in your terminal:
+
  enonic sandbox create mysandbox -t essentials -f
+
NOTE: `-f` flag will force using the most recent release of Enonic XP.
+
. Start the sandbox with this command:
+
  enonic sandbox start mysandbox --dev
+
NOTE: Dev mode optimizes the development process.

=== Task: Create and deploy an app

IMPORTANT: Let the sandbox run in the first terminal window, and open a new terminal window for the following commands.

. **Create a new project** using the `Introduction` app as a starter, by running the following command in your terminal:
+
 enonic project create -r tutorial-intro -n com.example.myproject -d myproject -v 1.0.0 --sb mysandbox
+
This command will:

* use the GitHub repo `github.com/enonic/tutorial-intro` as a starter
* to create an app called `com.example.myproject` with version `1.0.0`
* in the directory `myproject`
* and link it to `mysandbox` which you created earlier

. **Deploy the application**
+
Assuming `mysandbox` is still running in another Terminal window, run these commands:

  cd myproject
  enonic dev

The last command will build and deploy the app to `mysandbox`, then start watching for changes in the code to automatically rebuild as you work on it.

[NOTE]
====
Look for the following output to verify that the app has been built:

    BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 6s
    3 actionable tasks: 3 executed
    Waiting for changes to input files...
====

== Task: Open Admin dashboard

Let's have a look at the sandbox' web interface. Open http://localhost:8080[http://localhost:8080^] in your browser (or just click the link).

You should now see the Welcome page:

.Welcome page
image::xp-boot.png[The XP boot page, 1085w]

The Welcome page provides an overview of the sandbox, including installed application and https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/deployment/config[standard configuration files^].

NOTE: `My App` should be in the list, together with other applications that were automatically installed when you created the sandbox.

Click btn:[Log In as Guest] to open the XP admin dashboard. You should now see the following:

.The XP admin dashboard
image::xp-dashboard.png[The XP admin dashboard, {image-xl}]

You are now on the admin dashboard. The right hand menu (aka `XP menu`) enables navigation between admin tools. Admin tools may be injected as extensions via applications.

NOTE: If things don't look exactly the same, don't worry. In every new version of XP the background picture gets updated. Also, admin dashboard is automatically localized - based on your browsers preferred language.

== Task: Open Content Studio

https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/content-studio[Content Studio^] is the editorial interface used to create and manage content. It was pre-installed from https://market.enonic.com[Enonic Market^] as a part of the `Essentials` template when you started the sandbox, and can now be accessed from the XP menu.

*Click btn:[Content Studio]* in the XP menu to launch it.

The first time your application was deployed to the sandbox, it automatically created a content project called `Intro Project` and populated it with content. Since this is the only available project at the moment, Content Studio will automatically open it, revealing the list of sample content items.

TIP: The current project is shown at the top of Content Studio.

NOTE: Some of the content items will have a default preview. That's okay for now - you'll customize the preview later.

**Congrats on setting up the Enonic development environment**

With the SDK running, lets have a look at <<api-primer#, the API>>.
