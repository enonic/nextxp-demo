= Setting up Next.js
:toc: right
:toclevels: 3
:imagesdir: media/

In this chapter we will create a front-end application that renders content from the Enonic CMS (the app created in the previous chapters).

== Next.js at a glance

link:https://nextjs.org/[**Next.js**] runs on top of link:https://nodejs.org/en/[Node.js], and provides a shrink-wrapped approach to building sites using the link:https://reactjs.org/[React framework].
Next.js supports both client-side rendering and link:https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering[Server side rendering], as well as pre-generation of static HTML files.

== Task: Create the Next.js project

Create an empty folder, go inside and run the following command:

[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
npx degit git@github.com:enonic/nextxp-template.git
----

The "nextxp-template" is based on link:https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started[Next.js' own introduction app], so if you're familiar with that, you'll recognize the structure of the files.

The template includes some boilerplate we will customize, and an npm dependency aka Â´The Enonic Adapter` that facilitates and simplifies integration with Enonic.

=== Code overview

The following file structure should now exist within your new project folder:

.Next project files:
[source,files]
----
.env                                // <1>
src/
    middleware.ts                   // <2>
    components/                     // <3>
    phrases/                        // <4>
        en.json
    app/
        [locale]
            [[...contentPath]]/
                page.tsx            // <5>
            layout.tsx              // <6>
            error.tsx               // <7>
            not-found.tsx           // <8>
        api/                        // <9>
            preview/
                route.tsx
            renderable/
                route.tsx
            revalidate/
                route.tsx
----

<1> Environment variables are placed in this file
<2> Middleware file that routes requests based on locale
<3> Contains your implementation of CMS components
<4> Phrase files for multi-language support
<5> The main rendering file, catching all requests satisfying the pattern `/[locale]/[[...contentPath]]`
<6> Layout file that wraps all pages and adds common structures (eg. `<Header>`, `<LocaleContextProvider>`, etc.)
<7> Error page handler
<8> Not found page handler
<9> Folder containing API routes


== Task: Configure application

By default, the configuration should work for your setup, but verify it to be sure.

The following configuration values should match your environment:

..env extract:
[source,files]
----
# Provide a unique value which will be used to secure the preview mode
ENONIC_API_TOKEN=mySecretKey

# Enonic app name, must match the name of your app
ENONIC_APP_NAME=tutorial.nxp

# Enonic XP projects configuration for different locales
ENONIC_MAPPINGS=en:intro/hmdb <1>

# Absolute URL to Content API
ENONIC_API=http://127.0.0.1:8080/site <2>
----

<1> Mapping an XP project (intro) and site (/hmdb) to the Next.js router.
<2> Base URL of the Guillotine API, but without project and branch.

TIP: These configuration values can be overridden later when deploying your app to a live server.

== Task: Boot the server

Let's fire up the Next.js server and see if things are working as planned...

NOTE: Make sure <<enonic-setup#, Enonic XP and the Movie DB app are running on localhost:8080>> before you continue

Start Next.js in  **dev mode** by running the following commands from within your Next.js project folder:

    npm install
    npm run dev

If Next boots without errors, point your browser to http://localhost:3000[http://localhost:3000^] to see the glorious result.

[source]

Page:
{
  "type": "page",
  "path": "/"
}
Common:
{
  "get": {
    "displayName": "hmdb",
    "_id": "3584c396-25cb-497e-b1f4-dc2bf0de4b5a",
    "type": "portal:site",

    },
    "xAsJson": {}
  },
  "getSite": {
    "displayName": "hmdb",
    "_path": "/hmdb"
  }
}
----

[TIP]
====
Running Next in `dev` mode normally works fine. Should you however experience "strange issues" - try deleting the `.next/` folder and reboot

For more details on booting Next, check out the link:https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/cli[Next.js CLI docs].
====

== Next URL patterns

The URL structure of your front-end will mirror the structure of the content in the CMS. http://localhost:3000/[http://localhost:3000/^] will be mounted to the site root, which in our case has the internal path `/hmdb`.

Using the Movie Se7en as an example:

.Se7en as seen in Content Studio - internal path is `/hmdb/movies/se7en`
image:se7en-edit.png[title="Editing item in Content Studio - the path /hmdb/movies/se7en is highlighted",width=768px]

### Task: Visit some more pages

Give the default rendering a spin by trying out some other URLs, for example: +

* http://localhost:3000/movies[http://localhost:3000/movies^] +
* http://localhost:3000/persons[http://localhost:3000/persons^] +
* http://localhost:3000/persons/brad-pitt[http://localhost:3000/persons/brad-pitt^]

...etc.

**That's it for the basic Next.js setup.**

Next, we'll have a closer look at <<rendering-basics#, how to customize the rendering>>.
