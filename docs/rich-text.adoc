In this chapter you'll learn how to render Rich Text content.

== Intro

Enonic boasts a https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/cms/schemas/input-types/htmlarea[Rich Text input type] which, unlike basic text fields, may contain more complex concepts such as tables, images, links and custom components. Each of these will typically need to be processed during rendering to provide a contextually correct URL, ideal image sizes, etc.


== Sample content

Luckily, the sample data set contains everything we need to get going.
The `Bio` field for persons is a Rich Text input, and some Persons' data is even populated with relevant content, like you see below:

image::rich-text-bio.png[title="Rich text bio field for Lea Seydoux",width=662px]


== Task: Rich text rendering

Follow these steps to implement rendering of the Bio field in Next.js:

. *Update the Person query*
+
To properly render Rich text, we need access to additional metadata (such as links and images) within it.
+
To simplify things, Next.XP provides a `richTextQuery` helper function that generates the query for us. Also, this way we don't have to repeat the query for every rich text field.
+
Add a new query file to your project with the following content:
+
.src/components/queries/getPersonWithBio.ts
[source,Typescript]
----
include::{sourcedir}/components/queries/getPersonWithBio.ts[]
----
+
IMPORTANT: Since we use `${richTextQuery('bio')}`` now, that is dependant on registered macros, `getPerson` query must now be a function!
This guarantees that it is executed when querying for data, and all the macros are already registered.
+
For further insight, visit the https://developer.enonic.com/docs/developer-101/stable/rich-text[rich text chapter] in the Developer 101 tutorial, or have a look at the tutorial covering our standard https://developer.enonic.com/docs/react-spa[react components].

. *The RichTextView component*
+
Now that we got the data, we need to use `RichTextView` component that knows how to render it.
All we need to do is pass value of the `bio` field from the query response to the `RichTextView` component.
+
Create a new component with the following content:
+
.src/components/views/PersonWithBio.tsx
[source,tsx]
----
include::{sourcedir}/components/views/PersonWithBio.tsx[]
----
+
Add styling to the new component:
+
.src/components/views/PersonWithBio.module.css
[source,css]
----
include::{sourcedir}/components/views/PersonWithBio.module.css[]
----
. *Update the mapping*
+
Finally, we need to update the mappings to use the new query and view.
+
Replace the `getPerson` query with `getPersonWithBio` and `Person` view with `PersonWithBio`. It should look something like this:
+
.src/components/_mappings.ts
[source,Typescript]
----
import getPersonWithBio from './queries/getPersonWithBio';
import PersonWithBio from './views/PersonWithBio';

ComponentRegistry.addContentType(`${APP_NAME}:person`, {
    query: getPersonWithBio,
    view: PersonWithBio
});
----
+
. *That's it!*
+
The resulting page for http://localhost:3000/persons/lea-seydoux[Lea Seydoux] should look like this:
+
image::rich-text-no-macro.png[title="Person content rendered with rich text",width=1080px]

As you can see from the above screenshot, there is a missing component. The next chapter addresses this by looking into <<macros#, Macros>>.
