In this chapter you'll learn how to render rich text content.

== Intro

Enonic boasts a https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/cms/schemas/input-types/htmlarea[rich text input type]. Unlike basic text fields, rich text may contain more complex concepts such as tables, images, links and custom components. Each of these will typically need to be processed during rendering in order to provide a contextually correct URL, ideal image sizes etc.


== Sample content

Luckily, the sample data set contains everyting we need to get going.
The `Bio` field for persons is rich text, and some of the content is even populated with relevant content, like you see below:

== Task: Rich text rendering

Follow these steps to implement rendering of the bio field in Next.js

. *Update the Person query*
+
To properly render Rich text, we need access to additional metadata such as links, images within it.
+
To simplify things, Next.XP provides a `richTextQuery` helper function that generates the query for us. Also, this way we don't have to repeat the query for every rich text field.
+
Add a new query file to your project with the following content:
+
.src/components/queries/getPersonWithBio.ts
[source,Typescript]
----
include::{sourcedir}/components/queries/getPersonWithBio.ts[]
----
+
IMPORTANT: Since we use `${richTextQuery('bio')}`` now, that is dependant on registered macros, `getPerson` query must now be a function!
This guarantees that it is executed when querying for data, and all the macros are already registered.
+
For further insight, visit the https://developer.enonic.com/docs/developer-101/stable/rich-text[rich text chapter] in the Developer 101 tutorial, or have a look at the tutorial covering our standard https://developer.enonic.com/docs/react-spa[react components].

. *The RichTextView component*
+
Now that we got the data, we need to use `RichTextView` component that knows how to render it.
All we need to do is pass `bio` data from the query response to the `RichTextView` component.
+
Create new component with the following content:
+
.src/components/views/PersonWithBio.tsx
[source,tsx]
----
include::{sourcedir}/components/views/PersonWithBio.tsx[]
----
+
Add styling to the new component:
+
.src/components/views/PersonWithBio.module.css
[source,tsx]
----
include::{sourcedir}/components/views/PersonWithBio.module.css[]
----
. *Update the mapping*
+
Finally, we need to update the mappings to use the new query and view.
+
Simply replace the `getPerson` query with `getPersonWithBio` and `Person` view with `PersonWithBio`. It should look something like this:
+
.src/components/_mappings.ts
[source,Typescript]
----
import getPersonWithBio from './queries/getPersonWithBio';
import PersonWithBio from './views/PersonWithBio';

ComponentRegistry.addContentType(`${APP_NAME}:person`, {
    query: getPersonWithBio,
    view: PersonWithBio
});
----
+
. *That's it!*
+
The resulting page for http://localhost:3000/persons/lea-seydoux[Lea Seydoux] should look like this:
+
image::rich-text-no-macro.png[title="Person content rendered with rich text",width=1080px]

As you can see from the above screenshot, there is a missing component. The next chapter addresses this by looking into <<macros#, Macros>>.
