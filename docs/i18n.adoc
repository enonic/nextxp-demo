In this chapter you will learn what it takes to support multi-language for your site.

== Introduction

Next.js has native multi-language support, allowing your projects to switch language on the fly.

To back this, Content Studio has a feature called content layering.

== Task: Create a layered project

To demonstrate multi-language, you first need to activate support for translating your content in Content Studio. In our case, let's try Norwegian.

. **Create a new project** in Content Studio by clicking on the `Settings` cog icon, on the left-hand side of the grid. You will be presented with the currently available projects:
+
image:content-studio-settings.png[title="Project list",width=1024px]
+
Click `New...` button, and select type `Layer`. Then choose the `Movie DB` project as the parent
+
image:content-studio-create-layer.png[title="Layered project type",width=1024px]
+
Fill in the rest of the form, using the following values:
+
* *Name*: `Film DB`
* *Identifier*: `intro-no`
* *Language*: `norsk (no)`
* *Access mode*: `Public`
* Other fields may be skipped
+
After saving and closing the wizard, the new project should appear in the list.
+
. *Verify the new layer* by going back to the content list (via the pencil icon), and then switching context using the context selector in the top bar.
+
After switching context, you should see the following:
+
image:content-studio-filmdb.png[title="Film DB project",width=1024px]
+
. Finally *publish the project* by clicking the `Publish` button in the top bar.

== Task: Set up i18n in Next.js

Next, let's turn on multi-language support in Next.js.

. This template comes with proxy configured to do language detection and redirection.
Feel free to study the code in `src/proxy.ts` to get a better understanding of how it works.
+
. But you need to *configure the Enonic adapter*, by specifying which content project to use for each locale:
+
..env
[source,Properties]
----
// ...
ENONIC_MAPPINGS=en:intro/hmdb,no:intro-no/hmdb
// ...
----
+
Let's break down the syntax.
+
For each comma separated entry, you will find the following pattern: `<locale>:<repository>/<sitekey>`.
In the example above `en:intro/hmdb` and `no:intro-no/hmdb`.
+
The first entry will map to the `defaultLocale` that is used in the locale related methods in the NextJS adapter.
+
NOTE: The reason for repeating paths, is that the path may be different in each project/translation.
+
. Next, add the static texts file for every locale to the `src/phrases` folder.
The file name should be `<locale>.json`, e.g. `no.json` for Norwegian.
+
. Finally *restart your Next.js server* to pick up the changes to environment variables.


== Task: Translate and publish

As long as your preview configuration was working before you started, Content Studio should automatically be able to detect the right locale for each project.

NOTE: You may need to restart/rebuild your Next.js server for the changes to be picked up.

. In Content Studio, *Switch editing context* to the `Film DB` project by toggling in the top left corner of Content Studio.
+
Content Studio should automatically be able to detect the correct Next.js locale for the project. Select an item, and you should get a preview.
+
. *Translate the site content* by selecting the site content, then click `localize` (rather than edit..). This effectively takes you to the edit form. You may now show off your skills while translating the page to Norwegian.
+
. Once finished, click `Mark as Ready` and proceed to *publish the entire site* structure.
+
[TIP]
====
*Publish the entire tree* by selecting the tree icon in the publishing wizard.
image:content-studio-mark-as-ready.png[title="Click tree icon to include all children",width=819px]

====
+
. **Verify that your front-end is working**
+
Finally, by adding `/no` (i.e. `localhost:4242/no`) to the URL of your Next.js server you should now see the published content from the Norwegian project.


== Multi front-end setup

In some cases, you may prefer a setup where each language/market is served by a separate Next.js front-end, or you may simply have different sites accessing the same Enonic instance.

Setting up Next.js to do this is just like handling a single language. To enable Content Studio preview to know which Next.js server to use, some additional configuration will be required.

. *Update the Next.xp configuration file* for your Enonic installation by adding multiple entries:
+
NOTE: The sandbox configuration files are located in the sandbox' home directory inside your user's root directory at `.enonic/sandboxes/<your-sandbox-name>/home/config`. 
+
.com.enonic.app.nextxp.cfg
[source,properties]
----
# uncomment to override default values
# nextjs.default.secret=yourSecret
# nextjs.default.url=http://127.0.0.1:4242
#
# config 'someName'
nextjs.someName.secret=yourSecret
nextjs.someName.url=https://your.next-site.com
#
# config 'anotherName'
nextjs.anotherName.secret=yourOtherSecret
nextjs.anotherName.url=https://your.other-next-site.com
# ...
----
+
. *Assign the configuration to your site* by clicking the pencil icon next to the `Next.XP` app name in the site form, and selecting it from the list of named configurations:
+

== Accessing locale in views

Here are some insight on how to make further use of locales in your Next.js project.

. Locale is available as path parameter on the page
+
[source,TypeScript]
.src/app/[locale]/[[...contentPath]]/page.tsx
----
export type PageProps = {
    locale: string,
    contentPath: string[],
}

export default async function Page({params}: { params: PageProps }) {
    const {locale, contentPath} = params;
    // ...
}
----

. Result of `fetchContent()` call from `@enonic/nextjs-adapter/server` contains `MetaData` object (available in every view) that includes `locale` and `defaultLocale` along with other calculated runtime data:
+
[source,TypeScript,options="nowrap"]
----
import {PageComponent, RENDER_MODE, XP_REQUEST_TYPE} from '@enonic/nextjs-adapter';

export interface MetaData {
    type: string;
    path: string;
    requestType: XP_REQUEST_TYPE;
    renderMode: RENDER_MODE;
    requestedComponent?: PageComponent;
    canRender: boolean;
    catchAll: boolean;
    apiUrl: string;
    baseUrl: string;
    locale: string;
    defaultLocale: string;
}
----

You can also use `I18n.getLocale()` and `useLocaleContext()` to access locale in server-side and client-side components respectively.

== Localizing the views

So far we have only localized the content.
Here is how you can localize texts in your views:

. Remember, we added file for every locale to the `src/phrases` folder earlier ?

. Use `useLocaleContext` from `@enonic/nextjs-adapter` to access current locale in client-side components:
+
[source,TypeScript]
----
'use client';

import {useLocaleContext} from '@enonic/nextjs-adapter/client';

export default function ClientSideComponent() {
    const {locale, localize} = useLocaleContext();
    const localizedText = localize('text.key');
    // ...
}
----

NOTE: The `useLocaleContext` hook is only available in client-side components.

. In server-side components, you can use `I18n.getLocale()` from `@enonic/nextjs-adapter` todo the same:
+
[source,TypeScript]
----
import {I18n} from '@enonic/nextjs-adapter';

export default function ServerSideComponent() {
    const locale = I18n.getLocale();
    const localizedText = I18n.localize('text.key');
    // ...
}
----

Now that we have everything working, it's about time you <<deployment#, deploy to live servers>>.
