= Deploying to production
:toc: right

In this chapter you will launch cloud instances of both Enonic and Next - link them together, and see the glorious result.

== Introduction
To complete this chapter, you'll be using Enonic to host the XP side of things, and Vercel for the front-end - Vercel are the makers of Next.js.

NOTE: Both Enonic and Next.js are open source software projects and can be deployed more or less anywhere. Have a look at the https://developer.enonic.com/docs/hosting[Enonic platform hosting page] for more details.

== Task: Sign up to Enonic

Create an account to get a free developer instance of Enonic XP

. *Sign up* for a https://enonic.com/sign-up[free developer account].
. *Create a new solution using the `CMS essentials` template*. This will install applications like `Content Studio` and `Guillotine` automatically.

When the new solution has started, launch `Enonic XP Admin` to verify that everything is up and running.


== Task: Install your app

. **Connect Enonic CLI to the cloud** by running this command, and follow the instructions:
+
[source,bash,{subs}]
----
enonic cloud login
----
+
. **Install your enonic app** directly from the app folder by running this command:
+
[source,bash,{subs}]
----
enonic cloud app install
----
+
. **Verify that the app was installed** from `Solution` -> `Applications` in the Enonic Console.
. From XP Admin, **open Content Studio** to verify that your app automatically initialized the `Intro` project and imported content on the server, just like on your local machine.
. Just like <<sites#, you did it locally>> , **create a new site** called `Hmdb` and move all imported content there.
. Lastly, remember to create a localized version of the site <<i18n#, as you did before>>.

== Task: Expose API via route

The purpose of routes is to expose APIs and other endpoints in Enonic XP like `:8080/site/<project>/<branch>` to the internet.

. **Create a new ingress called "API"** from `Solution` -> `Ingresses`.
+
Use the following settings:
+
Target path:: `/site`
Public path:: `/api`
ID provider:: -empty-
+
. **Make a note of the route URL** - you will find it in the route details.

NOTE: The URL should look something like this: `https://account-solution-environment.enonic.net/api`.


== Task: Add your front-end to Git

Vercel (which will be hosting your front-end) will need write access to a Git repo with your code.

. **Create a new Git repo** - Vercel supports Github, Gitlab and Bitbucket.
+
. **Commit and push** your Next.js app files to the new repo.


== Task: Deploy Next app
You are now ready to deploy the the front-end application.

. Sign up to Vercel: https://vercel.com/
. Create a new project `enonic-tutorial` and connect it to the repo you created in the previous step.
. **Add the following environment variables** to the project (name: value):
+
* ENONIC_APP_NAME: <enonic app name (`tutorial.nxp` in this guide)>
* ENONIC_API: <enonic route URL>
* ENONIC_API_TOKEN: <yourSecret>
* ENONIC_MAPPINGS: en:intro/hmdb,no:intro-no/hmdb

. **Verify the result**.
The front-page of your app should now display a 404 - as you haven't published any content yet.
+
NOTE: Make a note of the URL to the Vercel app, you will need it later
+

+
TIP: Check the Vercel function logs if you are not getting the expected result.

== Task: Link Content Studio to Vercel
With the front-end running, you can link it to Content Studio to activate the preview, and start building pages once again.

TIP: To save time, you may export content from your local machine and import it to the server using the https://market.enonic.com/vendors/glenn-ricaud/data-toolbox[Data Toolbox app].

. **Install the Next.XP app** `Solution` -> `Applications` -> `Install` -> Search for `Next.XP`, select it an click install
. **Add configuration**.
+
image:console-configure-app.png[title="Configure the Next.XP application in the solution console",width=769px]
+
.Add the following lines to the app config field to override the default values:
[source,properties]
----
nextjs.default.url = <Vercel application URL>
nextjs.default.secret = <yourSecret>
----
+
TIP: Remember, you can also create named configurations if needed.
+
NOTE: If you imported content from your local environment, the following two steps can be skipped
. **Add the Next.XP app to the site** to activate preview.
. **Save and verify** that the configuration is working by testing the Content Studio preview.

== Task: Publish a page

It's time to test that everything is working.

. If you did not import content, **create the front-page** (once again) by using the page editor. Maybe something like this will do?
+

. **Go live** by publishing the new page, and verify that your live site gets updated. Voila!
